# Silicon Spike, an Arduino Trigger Box for TMS and Biopac

## Description
The Arduino Trigger Box project, developed at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Bologna, offers a reliable and efficient solution for triggering Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Biopac systems. Designed by Giuseppe Ippolito and Thomas Quettier, this open-source initiative aims to provide the scientific community with a cost-effective and customizable trigger box solution.

## Features
- Easy integration with TMS and Biopac systems.
- Customizable triggering sequences.
- Open-source code for community collaboration and improvement.
- Detailed setup and usage instructions.

## Installation (comming soon)
1. **Clone the Repository:** Use `git clone` to download the project files.
2. **Hardware Assembly:** Follow the hardware assembly guide provided in the `HardwareSetup.md` file.
3. **Software Setup:** Load the Arduino code onto your Arduino device using the Arduino IDE.
4. **Testing:** Perform a test run as detailed in the `TestingProtocol.md`.

## Usage  (comming soon)
- **Configuring Trigger Sequences:** Edit the Arduino script to customize the trigger sequences according to your experimental needs.
- **Running the System:** Instructions for running the system are provided in `UsageInstructions.md`.
