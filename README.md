# Silicon Spike, an Arduino Trigger Box for TMS

## Description
The Arduino Trigger Box project, developed at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience of Cesena (University of Bologna), offers a reliable and efficient solution for triggering Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Biopac systems. Designed by Giuseppe Ippolito and Thomas Quettier, this open-source initiative aims to provide the scientific community with a cost-effective and customizable trigger box solution.

## Features
- Easy integration with TMS and Biopac systems.
- Customizable triggering sequences.
- Open-source code for community collaboration and improvement.
- Detailed setup and usage instructions.
